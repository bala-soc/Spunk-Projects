# Analyzing FTP Log Using Splunk SIEM

## Introduction
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) log files contain valuable information about file transfers within a network. Analyzing FTP logs using Splunk SIEM enables security professionals to monitor file transfer activities, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will upload sample FTP log files to Splunk SIEM and perform various analyses to gain insights into FTP activity within the network.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the project, ensure the following:
- Splunk instance is installed and configured.
- FTP log data sources are configured to forward logs to Splunk.

## Steps to Upload Sample FTP Log Files to Splunk SIEM

### 1. Prepare Sample FTP Log Files
- Obtain sample [FTP log files](https://www.secrepo.com/maccdc2012/ftp.log.gz) in a suitable format (e.g., text files).
- Ensure the log files contain relevant FTP events, including timestamps, source IP, username, commands, filenames, etc.
- Save the sample log files in a directory accessible by the Splunk instance.

### 2. Upload Log Files to Splunk
- Log in to the Splunk web interface.
- Navigate to **Settings** > **Add Data**.

### 5. Review Settings
- Review other settings such as index, host, and sourcetype.
- Ensure the settings are configured correctly to match the sample FTP log file.

## Steps to Analyze FTP Log Files in Splunk SIEM

### 1. Search for FTP Events   
- Open Splunk interface and navigate to the search bar.
- Enter the following search query to retrieve FTP events
```
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=ftplog
```

<img width="1054" height="392" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d564e8c8-afa1-4c8d-a2b7-0a923472341f" />
<img width="1920" height="610" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/516c133e-4a27-41b2-8525-f9fc628e9130" />


### 2.  Extract Relevant Fields
- Identify key fields in FTP logs such as timestamps, source IP, username, commands, filenames, etc.
- Use Splunk's field extraction capabilities or regular expressions to extract these fields for better analysis.
- Example extraction command:
```
| rex field=_raw "^(?<timestamp>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}).*?(?<source_ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}).*?(?<username>\w+).*?(?<command>[A-Z]+).*?(?<file_path>\/[\w\/.-]+)
"
```

<img width="1920" height="311" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84bf7b53-14ec-41a9-ba64-07019201d23e" />
<img width="1920" height="569" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7869ff63-b9b3-4320-a260-d89b3e3d6fa2" />


Explanation:
- `^`: Start of the line.
- `(?<timestamp>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})`: Matches and captures the timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
- `.*?`: Matches any character (except for line terminators) as few times as possible.
- `(?<source_ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})`: Matches and captures the source IP address.
- `(?<username>\w+)`: Matches and captures the username (assuming it consists of alphanumeric characters).
- `(?<command>[A-Z]+)`: Matches and captures the FTP command (assuming it consists of uppercase letters).
- `(?<file_path>\/[\w\/.-]+)`: Matches and captures the file path (assuming it starts with "/" and can contain alphanumeric characters, "/", ".", and "-").


### 3. Analyze File Transfer Activity
- Determine the frequency and volume of file transfers.

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count as transfer_count by command
```


<img width="1920" height="621" alt="12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/002f52ba-a42f-449e-8b04-7383fd640fde" />

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| timechart span=1h count as transfer_volume
```


<img width="1920" height="881" alt="14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e83b69-c150-46e1-877c-4c403dea1501" />
  
- Identify top users or IP addresses involved in file transfers.

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s21\s+(?<username>\S+)"
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count as transfers by username
| sort -transfers
```

<img width="1920" height="679" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef89b88-e380-4ed2-9f13-112002fb59c8" />

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<src_ip>\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})\s"
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count as transfers by src_ip
| sort -transfers
```

<img width="1920" height="873" alt="16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a54ba314-8a0f-4560-b7f2-dadadab9808f" />

  
- Analyze the types of files being transferred (e.g., documents, executables, archives).

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| eval file_type=case(
    command="STOR","Upload",
    command="RETR","Download"
)
| stats count by file_type
```

<img width="1920" height="652" alt="17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f26f5ad-fea5-424f-b745-dc0c802053ee" />

  
- Use stats command to calculate statistics such as count, sum, avg, etc.

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count avg(count) as avg_transfers
```

<img width="1920" height="564" alt="18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0311f021-e584-4a0c-bbd0-3e277e4f8de1" />



### 4. Detect Anomalies
- Look for unusual patterns in file transfer activity.

```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count by command
```

  
<img width="1920" height="603" alt="19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8918c2aa-25be-4ed3-ba6e-ecb3a8ee9057" />

  
- Analyze sudden spikes or drops in file transfer volume.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| timechart span=1h count
```

<img width="1920" height="875" alt="20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1b4fbf-332c-455d-a2da-6230032be485" />

  
- Investigate file transfers to or from suspicious IP addresses.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<src_ip>\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})\s"
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| search NOT src_ip="192.168.*"
| stats count by src_ip
```
<img width="1920" height="475" alt="21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b2199e-769b-4d1e-a409-05689fcf446d" />

  
- Use statistical analysis or machine learning models to detect anomalies.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| timechart span=1h count as ftp_activity
| eventstats avg(ftp_activity) as avg stdev(ftp_activity) as stdev
| eval upper_limit = avg + (3 * stdev)
| where ftp_activity > upper_limit
```

<img width="1920" height="586" alt="22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7b08af-bc93-4100-8229-d4f20d6800f5" />



### 5. Monitor User Behavior
- Monitor user behavior during file transfers.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s21\s+(?<username>\S+)"
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<command>RETR|STOR)\s"
| stats count by username command
```

<img width="1920" height="782" alt="23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fec8e338-6bc1-4146-bf76-4be26c2194ef" />

- Identify users with multiple failed login attempts or unauthorized access attempts.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s21\s+(?<username>\S+)"
| rex field=_raw "\s(?<response_code>4\d{2}|5\d{2})\s"
| stats count as failures by username
| where failures > 3
```

<img width="1920" height="647" alt="24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b5c54e-e1e4-4b8e-92aa-7756c0f79295" />

- Analyze user activity patterns and deviations from normal behavior.
  
```spl
index=_* OR index=* sourcetype=dnslog
| rex field=_raw "\s21\s+(?<username>\S+)"
| stats count as activity by username
| eventstats avg(activity) as avg
| where activity > avg * 2
```

<img width="1920" height="569" alt="25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4671e501-c93f-4091-ad19-7f40dbaa5e86" />

## Conclusion
Analyzing FTP log files using Splunk SIEM provides valuable insights into file transfer activities within a network. By monitoring FTP events, detecting anomalies, and correlating with other logs, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect against various cyber threats.
